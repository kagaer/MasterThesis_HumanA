Preprocessing Scripts Order:

1. CreateDB 
    - creates the Database tables for the raw participant data
2. CreateAvatarsDB
    - creates the Database table for the raw Avatars data
3. CreateGraph
    - creates the graph from the CSV file of the Master Thesis of Mellissa and stores it in the database
4. RecreateGraphFromDB
    - use this code to recreate the graph from the database
5. Create_Density_Matrix
    - creates a density matrix from the raw data for each participant and saves it to the database
    - creates full density matrix over all participants and stores it in the database
6. Density_Plots
    - creates density matrix plots of both experiments and calculates the normalized integral of each matrix
    - NOTE: needs some adjustment (check Mellis renewed script)
7. Avatar_Reduction
    - saves only necessary information of the raw avatar data & converts coordinates
8. Graph_Coordinates
    - saves the elements of the graph with the corresponding coordinates
    - information about the node: nodeRadius, nodeCentroid x and z, corresponding x and z coordinates (pixel values)
    - information about the edges: edgeStart & edgeEnd (neighbouring nodes nrs), corresponding x and z coordinates (pixel values) 
9. Data_Reduction
    - matches each coordinate to an element of the graph and throws out duplicate datapoints (where participants stayed longer on one element)
10. Graph_Element_Correction_On_Datapoints
    - checks for all datapoints that don't have a matching element (due to same distance to multiple elements before)
    - throws out remaining duplicates
    - adds an element to the datapoint that matches the previous and next datapoints elements
11. Coordinates_to_Graph_Element
    - maps each coordinate to a corresponding graph element, for participants datapoints as well as for avatar coordinates
    - TODO: take out the participant part of this, because that is done in the previous script
12. Check_Continuity_Datapoints
    - checks if the routes correspond to a continous route within the graph, starting with the start point
    - adjusts datapoints (if it is only one datapoint in a row)
    - saves information about false files
